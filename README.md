# Travel Matcher App
This app lets users enter their itinerary which will show up as markers on a map or chronologically in a calendar within the app. After which the app will then find people who have similar plans so you can connect and share the experience together. This is mainly aimed a solo travellers / backpackers but could be used by potentially anyone as a means to meet new people without the hassle of posting in forums and Facebook groups which could get lost easily or not get responses at all.
